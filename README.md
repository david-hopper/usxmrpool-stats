# usxmrpool-stats
*Created with language: Python3*

Itâ€™s fairly simple to make something like this with a number of programming languages, but
if you want me to build one for your favorite pool in Python3, let me
know!

Modules needed to run this script -->

- tkinter
- urllib.request
- ast

The latter two were preinstalled on my machine with Python, but you may need to install tkinter.
